                    <h2><a href="https://html.com/#What_is_HTML">1. HTML Introduction</a></h2><br>
                    <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. 
                        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was
                         published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 
                         version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and 
                         this version was published in 2012.</p>

                    <h2><a href="#"> 2. HTML Attributes</a></h2><br>
                    <p>We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags paragraph tag and other tags. 
                        We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.
                        Where element names the HTML element type, and attribute is the name of the attribute, set to the provided value.
                         The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML)</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://html.com/#HTML_Editors">3. HTML Editors </a></h2> <br>
                    <p> An HTML editor is a specialized piece of software that assists in the creation of HTML code. 
                        Similar to text editors such as Notepad and TextEdit, HTML editors allow users to enter raw text. Like any software, different HTML editors have different features. However, there are some features that are inherent in most HTML editors. For example, one would expect that even the most basic of HTML editors would include the "autocomplete" feature (where the editor automatically inserts closing tags, double quotes for attributes etc).</p>

                    <h2><a href=" https://www.educba.com/types-of-tags-in-html/">5. Paired and Unpaired Tags</a></h2><br>
                    <p> An HTML tag is known as a paired tag when the tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag as its companion tag. An HTML Paired tag starts with an opening tag: the tag name enclosed inside the angle brackets; for example, a paragraph opening tag is written. The content follows the opening tag, which ends with an ending tag: the tag name starting with a forward slash; for example, an ending paragraph tag is written. The first tag can be referred to as the ‘Opening Tag’, and the second tag can be called Closing Tag.</p>

                    <p>The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.</p>

                    <p>The background attribute can also be used to control the background of an HTML element, specifically page body and table backgrounds. You can specify an image to set background of your HTML page or table.</p>
