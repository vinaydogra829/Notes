                    <h2><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/what_is_css.htm">1. CSS Introduction</a></h2><br>
                    <p> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_colors.htm">2. CSS Colours</a></h2><br>
                    <p>CSS uses color values to specify a color. Typically, these are used to set a color either for the foreground of an element (i.e., its text) or else for the background of the element. They can also be used to affect the color of borders and other decorative effects.</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_images.htm">3. Images </a></h2><br>
                    <p>Images play an important role in any webpage. Though it is not recommended to include a lot of images, but it is still important to use good images wherever required. The border property of an image is used to set the width of an image border. This property can have a value in length or in %.</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_borders.htm">4. Borders</a></h2><br>
                    <p>The border-color property allows you to change the color of the border surrounding an element. You can individually change the color of the bottom, left, top and right sides of an element's border using the properties. The border properties allow you to specify how the border of the box representing an element should look. There are three properties of a border you can change</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_padding.htm">5. Padding</a></h2><br>
                    <p>The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border. The value of this attribute should be either a length, a percentage, or the word inherit. If the value is inherit, it will have the same padding as its parent element. If a percentage is used, the percentage is of the containing box. </p>

                    <h2><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_dimension.htm">6. Dimensions</a></h2><br>
                    <p>You have seen the border that surrounds every box ie. element, the padding that can appear inside each box and the margin that can go around them. In this tutorial we will learn how we can change the dimensions of boxes. The height and width properties allow you to set the height and width for boxes. They can take values of a length, a percentage, or the keyword auto.</p>

                    <h2><a href=" https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css3_shadow.htm">7. CSS Shadow</a></h2> <br>
                    <p> The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations. Each shadow is described by some combination of X and Y offsets from the element, blur radius, and color.Each shadow is specified as two or three <length> values, followed optionally by a <color> value. The first two <length> values are the <offset-x> and <offset-y> values. The third, optional, <length> value is the <blur-radius>. The<color> value is the shadow's color.</p>
